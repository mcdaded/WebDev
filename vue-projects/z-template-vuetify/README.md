# my-vuetify-npm


Based on a really good tutorial found here:
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-single-page-application-using-vue-js-vuex-vuetify-and-firebase-838b40721a07


Putting a few interesting links and pieces of information below
- Vuetify colors: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/framework/colors
- Vuetify icons: https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline

running `npm run lint` is super cool too just to get everything set up with the
right spacing and formatting. Seems better than beautify.
