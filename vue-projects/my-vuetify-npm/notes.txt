Based on a really good tutorial found here:

Putting a few interesting links and pieces of information below
- Vuetify colors: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/framework/colors
- Vuetify icons: https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline

running npm run lint is super cool too just to get everything set up with the
right spacing and formatting. Seems better than beautify.
